## You can always count on me when...

You encounter a problem because 
  I'm very determined and I won't hesitate to help you even if it takes time and I have to explain in different ways.
  
## A funny story

When I was on holidays with my family, I found friends to play with. We went for a walk. We saw a big hole next to the road. I decided to jump over so I could impress the others. Obviously, I missed my jump and fell into the hole which was full of brambles and nettles. I ended up with a lot of pimples and bites all over my body. I cried the whole afternoon...

### TL;DR

Don't jump over holes if you don't know what's inside.
